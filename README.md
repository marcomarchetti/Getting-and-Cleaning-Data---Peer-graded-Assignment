Submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

## Overview

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.  
The source data set for this project was obtained from the Human Activity Recognition using Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers.  
The source data set is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).  

This project uses the source data to create a Tidy Data set contains the average of each source data variable for each activity and each subject.  

This repository contains the following files:

* `README.md` this file, which provides an overview of the project.

* `TidyData.csv` contains independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* `run_analysis.R` R script that was used to create the Tidy data set

* `CodeBook.md` describes how to use all this, variables, data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.
